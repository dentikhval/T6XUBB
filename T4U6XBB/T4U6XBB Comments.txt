
TEENSY Pin (Old designation in GrblHAL) - New Designation

30 (ST1) - LIM C
36 (ST0) - LIM 7

40 (STEN Y) - Step C
39 (STEN Z) - Dir C
38 (STEN A) - Step 7
37 (STEN B) - Dir 7
35 (ST3) - ST1
34 (ST2) - ST0


Changes:
Made fully optoisolated inputs on all inputs
Inputs have changed polarity and now require external power!!
Removed Vacuum / dust collector functionality
Removed ST0-ST3 5V inputs with protection circuitry, left 2 of them (pins remapped)
Added C and 7 axes, with limit switch inputs and STEP, DIR outputs
Added space for capacitors for limit switch inputs to suppress noise
Removed individual ENABLE for all axes except X,
Now there's only one Enable / Brake release for all motors
Rearranged position of spindle PWM to 0-10V converter - bugs possible
Rearranged ground plane - bugs possible
Added 2 LDOs on input power - one from Vin to 12V and other 12V to 5V. TEENSY does the 5v to 3.3v conversion. possible to power board with 24V (maybe)
